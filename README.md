# CRUD-express-mongo
Create, Read Update and Delete on a Mongo Mlab databe using express

This program is using Mlab as mongo database.
For this to work, you nedd to change <dbuser> and <dbpassword> for your own information provided by the website.
 
 Or you can use  a local mongo db (wich I find really suck to set-up).
 
 This program basicaly create author and quotes, recording it in a database.
 
 The button "update" chages the last CBJR author by a Darth Vader phrase.
 
 The button "delete" deletes the last Darth Vader phrase.
 
 enjoy :)
